1.  Introduction

   The DPRIVE working group has two active documents that provide DNS
   confidentiality, DNS over DTLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls] and DNS
   over TLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-start-tls-for-dns].

   This document defines a profile of DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] and TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246] that offers DNS privacy.  Profile thereby means the
   available configuration options and protocol extensions are utilized
   to best support DNS privacy.  This document also shows message flows
   for those two documents.

2.  (D)TLS Profile

   It is expected that both DNS over DTLS and DNS over TLS will take
   advantage of

   o  TLS session resumption without server-side state [RFC5077], which
      eliminates the need for the server to retain cryptographic state
      for longer than necessary, and;

   o  TLS False Start [I-D.ietf-tls-falsestart], which reduces round-
      trips by allowing the TLS second flight of messages
      (ChangeCipherSpec) to also contain the (encrypted) DNS query, and;

   o  Cached Information Extension [I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info], which
      avoids transmitting the server's certificate and certificate chain
      if the client has cached that information from a previous TLS
      handshake, and;.

   o  Raw public keys [RFC7250], which reduce the size of the
      ServerHello, and don't have to pay the price of certificates and
      public key infrastructure (PKI), and;

   o  TLS Extension Definitions [RFC6066] lowers the maximum fragment
      length support needed for the Record Layer from 2^14 bytes to 2^9
      bytes.  This extension allows the DNS client to indicate to the
      DNS server how much the input that the record layer may process
      without fragmentation (that is, the maximum value of
      TLSPlaintext.length; see [RFC5246], Section 6.2.1), and;

   o  Profiled TLS 1.2 (but quickly move to support TLS 1.3
      [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] which reduces round trips).  The interaction
      between the DNS client and the DNS server requires Transport Layer
      Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) with a
      ciphersuite offering confidentiality protection and the guidance
      given in [RFC7525] must be followed to avoid attacks on DTLS, and;

   o  Authenticating the DNS server using certificates or Raw public
      keys is discussed in Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls].

2.1.  DTLS

   With DTLS, the client is immediately informed of the server state
   loss with a DTLS Alert, as shown in the diagram below.  This costs
   one round trip.

          client                                          server

             |                                               |
             |                                        (state lost)
             |                                               |

                     Figure 1: Server State Loss, DTLS

   An optimization of the above flow is possible, if we consider that
   the server is more likely to have lost state if the most recent DNS
   query was sent a "long time ago" (exact value of "long time" is
   debatable).  In that situation, the DNS-over-DTLS client can send a
   TLS handshake with TLS resumption -- effectively, it sends the TLS
   handshake identical to packet (3) of Figure 1 (avoiding packets 1 and

   2).  This packet is larger, though, as it contains the TLS session
   resumption information.  Thus, it is a trade-off of a larger message
   versus a (possible) round trip savings.  This message flow is shown
   below.

       client                                              server

2.2.  TLS

   With TLS, the client is immediately informed of server state loss
   with a TCP RST, as shown in the diagram below.  This costs one round
   trip , and is unavoidable.

      Open Issue: Does TCP RST cause one second delay on Windows, or was
      this just behavior on Windows Vista and XP during session
      establishment (see slide 11 of [RST-delay])?  Needs testing.

   If the client and server TCP stacks both support TCP Fast Open (TFO)
   [RFC7413], the TCP 3-way handshake can be done without a round trip,
   as shown below.  Currently, TFO is supported in Linux 3.7 (TCP client
   and server), iOS 9, and OS X 10.11.

3.  Probing for Server State Loss

   In between normal DNS traffic while the communication to the DNS
   server is quiescent, the DNS client may want to probe the server to
   ensure it has maintained cryptographic state.  Such probes can also
   keep alive firewall or NAT bindings.  This probing reduces the
   frequency of needing a new handshake when a DNS query needs to be
   resolved, improving the user experience at the cost of bandwidth and
   processing time; cellular devices could even send the probes while in
   power-save state [I-D.isomaki-rtcweb-mobile].

   If the server has lost state, a DTLS (or TLS) handshake needs to be
   initiated with the server.

3.1.  DTLS

   A DTLS heartbeat [RFC6520] verifies the server still has DTLS state
   by returning a DTLS message.  If the server has lost state, it
   returns a DTLS Alert.

Internet-Draft  DPRIVE TLS/DTLS Profile and Message Flows September 2015


3.2.  TLS

   TLS runs over TCP, so a simple probe is a 0-length TCP packet (a
   "window probe").  This verifies the TCP connection is still working,
   which is also sufficient to prove the server has retained TLS state,
   because if the server loses TLS state it abandons the TCP connection.
   If the server has lost state, a TCP RST is returned immediately.

4.  NAT or Firewall Pinhole Closed

   A NAT or Firewall, on the path between the DPRIVE client and DPRIVE
   server, lose state -- either due to timing out the pinhole,
   exhausting its resources (and needing to prematurely close the
   pinhole), or crashing.  This differs from the server losing state.

                  Figure 5: NAT/Firewall State Loss, DTLS

4.2.  TLS

   With a TCP connection when the NAT or firewall has lost state and
   sees a TCP packet without the SYN bit set, there are several possible
   reactions by the NAT or firewall:

   o  send TCP RST, spoofing the source IP address of the original
      packet's destination address.  This is shown in the following
      figure.

   o  create state.  A firewall is unlikely to create state when it sees
      an in-progress TCP packet, but some NATs may create state.
      However, if the NAT creates state for a different source TCP port
      than the previous connection, the server will reject the TCP
      packet as shown above in Figure 4.  This message flow is not
      shown.
